## ‚ú® About The Project

`interstellar` is a creative coding endeavor aimed at exploring and visualizing cosmic phenomena. By leveraging WebGL for rendering and custom GLSL shaders for complex visual effects, this project simulates a journey through a stylized universe. From shimmering starfields to glowing nebulae, the goal is to create an immersive and beautiful experience directly in the web browser.

This repository contains the source code for the simulation, including the HTML structure, CSS styling, JavaScript logic for scene management, and the GLSL code for the vertex and fragment shaders that give the visuals their unique look and feel.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

This project is built with a combination of web-native technologies and graphics programming.

*   **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** (52.3%): Core application logic, scene setup, and user interaction.
*   **[GLSL](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/OpenGL_Shading_Language)** (32.7%): Custom shaders for rendering stars, effects, and celestial bodies.
*   **[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)** (7.6%): Styling for the HTML overlay and user interface.
*   **[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)** (7.4%): The foundation for the web page.
*   *And* **[Three.js](https://threejs.org/)** and similar WebGL libraries to manage the 3D scene and rendering pipeline.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser and Node.js installed.
*   **Node.js** (which includes npm)
    ```sh
    https://nodejs.org/
    ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ProfessorQuantumUniverse/interstellar.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd interstellar
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages** (if you have dependencies like a local server or build tool)
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Run the project**
    *   If you are using a simple local server, you might run:
        ```sh
        npm start
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can often open the `index.html` file directly in your browser.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Usage

Once the project is running, you can explore the simulation.
*   **Look around:** Use your mouse to change the camera's orientation.
*   **Move:** Use the `WASD` keys to navigate through space.
*   *(Add any other specific interactions here!)*
